_The Limits to Growth_ by Meadows et al. (1972) presented a system dynamics model of the global ecosystem and economy. The original simulation was written in a language called DYNAMO. The code in this repository, written in 2012, attempts to translate the DYNAMO program into JavaScript.

You can run the program in a web browser at [http://bit-player.org/extras/limits/ltg.html](http://bit-player.org/extras/limits/ltg.html).
